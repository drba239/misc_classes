Kline \& Katari (2016)
examines the effect of 
Connecticut's Jobs First (JF)
welfare reform experiment,
which randomized participants between
the JF program and the traditional
Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)
program. The JF program differed from 
AFDC program on various policy-relevant dimensions,
including strengthening work requirements
and structuring the disregard of earnings 
to incentivize work under the FPL.
The authors develop a non-parametric 
optimization model of labor supply
that allows for unrestricted heterogeneity
across women, a very permissive 
model relative to more conventional approaches.
The authors are interested in the 
extensive and intensive margin responses 
of women's labor supply. 

They face the 
standard challenge of observing 
only the marginal distributions of the potential outcomes
under each treatment, but not the joint distribution.
Still, they make progress on set identifying
a variety of parameters of interest under their model 
by 1) considering a 
reduced state space consisting of the combined information on 
whether the 
individual participated in the welfare program,
whether they under-reported their income, and 
a coarsened earnings variable indicating whether 
earnings were zero, below the FPL, or over the FPL,
2) employing a set of 
``revealed preference'' restrictions
founded upon the idea that if a woman's utility 
under her AFDC choice was not lowered by the JF program,
then she will either make the same or a utility-improving 
choice, and 3) utilizing a set of non-negativity and summation
constraints on probabilities and mutual exclusivity of 
choices.

The authors find that the JF program
induced a substantial opt-in effect 
in which (at least 20\% of the feasible) 
women who would have earned 
above the FPL without welfare under AFDC chose to
earn below the FPL and receive 
welfare under JF. They also find a small, but significant
effect of JF on women choosing to under-report their earnings 
to receive welfare, as well as a meaningful increase 
in the share of women earning below the FPL 
who chose to receive welfare (at least 32\% of the 
relevant group). They also find evidence that (between 14\% and 
20\% of the relevant subset of) women 
moved from non-work to work under the JF. 

A weakness of the paper is that it
is limited in what types of conclusions 
it can draw. For example, it cannot speak to 
movement within the coarse earnings categories, which is 
something that is likely important for considering the
welfare
effect of the policy -- probably most significantly, movement in 
earnings among people under the FPL. The details of the 
earnings movement from those that earn above the FPL 
under AFDC but under the FPL under JF are also important 
and are given some attention in the robustness section.
However, this ``weakness'' is 
tightly related to one of the key strengths of the paper,
which seems to be the credibility derived 
from minimizing assumptions by employing a permissive
non-parametric model and relying on informative 
partial identification. 

When I think through the process of 
trying to develop a paper like this, I think that 
I could benefit from a better understanding 
of: once we've realized that 
we can group income and restrict the types of movement 
via revealed preference arguments,
what qualities of the problem at this point make 
us think about re-structuring the state space 
and constructing it as a linear program
to make progress?
Once we've narrowed in on the response probabilities, 
we can see that we're still under-identified 
due to the number of equalities and unknowns, 
but do we look at the problem, notice
that the parameters of interest are all 
linear in the constraints, and, at that point, 
carry out the linear programming exercise
and just find out if we've reduced the 
equalities sufficiently
to get informative set identification?
Are there classes of problems that 
it would be helpful for me to have in mind
as being possible to 
tackle with this variety of approach?
