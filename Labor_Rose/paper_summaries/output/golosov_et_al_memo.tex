\title{Golosov et al. Memo}

\begin{document}

Golosov et al. (2024) explores 
numerous questions concerning 
the effects of exogenous 
changes in household wealth 
and unearned labor. 
To do so, they analyze US tax records, 
with a focus on the ``treated'' 
group of individuals who 
won the lottery.
Initially, they analyze the 
earnings response to a lottery win.
They consider a number of possible 
estimators, including 
simply taking first differences, adding 
time effects, and using a diff-in-diff,
with various possible control
groups. All estimators yield 
similar results in this setting, 
and they proceed with the diff-in-diff
with the control group 
of individuals who did not yet win the lottery
but would eventually. They use an event 
study design.
They find that the wage earnings of a lottery win 
fall, on average, by 
$\$ 3,572$ ($\sim$10\%), in the first year after winning.

Notably, the effect discussed in the
last paragraph captures
the effect of a lottery win, but is difficult to 
interpret since it doesn't convey information
about the amount of the win.
The authors then use an instrumental variable
approach to estimate wealth effects
using variation in the timing of lottery wins
as the instrument. They find that 
an extra \$100 of wealth is 
associated with winners reducing 
their earnings by \$2.3 
in each of the five subsequent year and
increasing their capital income by \$0.9.
For every \$100,000 of additional wealth,
employment probability decreased by 3.7 p.p.
They find meaningful heterogeneity in these
results across the pre-win income 
distribution, e.g., 
lower-income households were more likely to stop working.

The authors then turn to 
propensity to 
earn and consume out of unearned income. 
They compare results from 
using the annuitization method 
and the capitalization method.
They find similar results through either method,
which say 
that consumption increases 
in the first post-win year 
by between \$4,862 and \$5,176.
They also estimate the MPE and MPC
with the IV method and consider 
hetereogeneity along 
age, gender, and marital status.
The authors then consider a number of 
dimensions along which winners 
might respond. They find 
a significant increase in propensity to 
exit the labor force, 
a small increase in the probability of
becoming self-employed with an income below 
\$15,000, no effect on the probability of starting 
a business, no effect on the frequency 
of job moves (though with hetereogeneity in which 
people have an increase in the probability of 
moving to a lower-paying employer and a symmetric 
decrease in the probability of moving to a higher-paying employer),
an increase in the probability of moving (particularly 
among low-income winners), an increase in the probability of 
getting married, and a decrease in the probability of 
getting divorced.
When comparing against other similar studies,
they find reasonably similar results 
with other studies in the American context,
but that past studies were distorted by overstating 
the post-tax wealth increase among winners. 
They find generally larger effects 
than those among European datasets using similar types 
of data.

One of the clear strengths of the paper 
seems to be the quality and size of the dataset,
combined with the clean identification 
strategy through the usage of lotteries, that allows the authors 
to get around some of the common pitfalls 
of past efforts to analyze the questions of interest.
One kind of foundational point of confusion on my part is 
that in the IV approach, I'm not 
totally sure if I understand what they mean when they 
say they use 
timing variation in the lottery win as an instrument.
Additionally, particularly at the lower end of the income distribution,
I would've been interested to see the conditional 
effects at a more granular level than quartile, since 
it seems that there's a meaningful difference between someone 
in the bottom e.g. 5 percentiles versus the bottom 25 percentiles.
One challenge in the heterogeneity analysis, as the authors allude to,
is that it's unclear if the variable that we're comparing 
effects across is the instructive variable \emph{per se}
versus simply being correlated with variables influencing
the effects.
