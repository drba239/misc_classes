\title{Card \& Hyslop Memo}

\begin{document}

Card \& Hyslop (2005) 
analyzed the effect of 
Canada's Self Sufficiency Project (SSP)
on welfare usage and labor market outcomes 
among participants.
SSP was a welfare program intended 
to be more conducive to work 
among recipients than 
traditional welfare programs.
In particular, it began with a one-year 
time limit to establish a subsidy payment, and once 
initiated, functioned as a negative income tax with 
a 50\% tax rate, a higher ``guarantee level'' than 
traditional welfare programs, and a 
minimum hours requirement 
of at least 30 hours a week.
In contrast, the traditional program in Canada,
called Income Assistance (IA), recipients 
experienced a 100\% implicit tax rate above 
a certain threshold, discouraging work.
Participants were placed into one of the 
two programs randomly, which aids in 
experimental analysis. 

The authors first provide a 
direct comparison between the two groups 
to capture the trends in the data.
Overall, the program 
led to a rise in employment 
among the treated group in the 
short run, peaking 
at 14 p.p. higher in months 12-13 
post-randomization, but this 
effect decreases to 
6 p.p. by month 36 and 
reaches 0 by month 52. 
Similarly, 
the experiment was associated with a 
\$125 increase in monthly earnings in the short-run,
again peaking in months 12-13, 
and again disappearing by month 52. 
Moreover, the vast majority 
of jobs obtained by the treated group
seem to be very close to minimum wage.
They also do not find evidence of 
distributional differences between the 
groups by month 52.

The authors point out that the structure 
of the program provides 
a substantial challenge to analyzing the 
effects of the two components of 
the program separately, i.e., the 
time limit and the subsidy change.
In particular, the group of individuals
who successfully meet SSP eligibility 
requirements by initiating the subsidy
within the time limit are endogenously 
determined and may be different 
from the individuals who don't initiate the subsidy,
as well as the individuals in the control group.
Indeed, the group who qualified 
was younger and more likely to be 
working just before randomization.
The authors proceed with a model-based 
approach to disentangle the effects of 
each component of the program.
They begin by writing out a simple 
dynamic model of work and welfare decisions 
under SSP. They then estimate and validate a variety of 
models of welfare participation for the 
IA group
to establish a counterfactual.  
Finally, building on the last two steps, 
they devise an econometric model 
for estimating and interpreting each 
effect of SSP's key components.
Overall, they find that the establishment 
effects drive a majority of the results.

This paper was very interesting, and the model-based 
efforts to decompose the effects of the two components
was compelling. However, much of the analysis was 
assumption-heavy, and it left me wondering if 
there would be a partial identification approach 
that might provide informative (albeit less 
precise) insights into the question of interest
with fewer assumptions.
Additionally, 
it is slightly unclear to me how 
I should think about the implications of 
this analysis of the experiment as a 
matter of prospective public policy. 
In particular, in addition
to being unsure of the effects 
if scaled up, I'm also not sure 
how to think about a policy rooted 
in a time limit as a continuously,
rather than sporadically, 
applied rule -- or if it is 
formalized in a continuous fashion, it seems 
the details of the formalization would influence 
how this paper connects to the policy (though the 
economic behavior documented is very interesting 
in any case).
