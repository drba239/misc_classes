\textbf{Summary of Paper}

``Tradeoffs and Comparison Complexity''
examines the role of tradeoffs 
in informing comparison complexity.
The authors propose
a theory of comparison complexity 
and flesh out its details
in the context of 
multiattribute, lottery, and intertemporal choice.
The authors model 
a decision maker (DM) who faces a set of alternatives 
and receives a noisy signal concerning their 
value, which is informed by the ease of comparison
between alternatives, $\tau_{xy}$ for 
alternatives $x$ and $y$.
The authors ground their theory in two 
reasonably simple principles: 
comparisons are easier when alternatives are similar
and are maximally easy when one alternative dominates the other.
Importantly, the authors take 
the comparability of alternatives to be 
an increasing transformation of the 
value-dissimilarity ratio,
$\frac{\left|v_x-v_y\right|}{d(x, y)}$, where 
the numerator is the difference in the 
value of alternatives $x$ and $y$
and the denominator is their dissimilarity.

In elaborating on their theory in the context of 
their three aforementioned settings,
the authors provide more structure on 
the components of the value-dissimilarity ratio 
and the probability 
of making a given choice, as well as provide 
axiomatic foundations for their characterizations.
Through this setup, the authors offer 
a tractable model with parameters 
identifiable from binary choice data.
They then extend this setup to 
multinomial choice.
