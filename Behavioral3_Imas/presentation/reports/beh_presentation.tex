\begin{frame}{Variation in Parameters and Pre-Registered Simple Points}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The authors 
        varied the central decision-relevant 
        parameter over a wide range, which 
        they argue moves problem complexity,
        to explore the ``demand side'' 
        of information-processing.
    \vfill
    \item In most experiments, they included 
        ``potential simple points'' at natural
        boundaries at which optimizing was 
        expected to be easy.
\end{itemize}
    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cognitive Uncertainty Elicitation}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The authors elicited cognitive uncertainty 
            essentially by asking participants
            how certain they were that they 
            optimized.
        \vfill
        \item Example:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Continuous decisions in subjective tasks, illustrated by Effort supply: 
                ``How certain are you that completing somewhere between [Y-1] and [Y+1] tasks is actually your best decision, given your preferences?''

                \item Note that attenuation is present
                    across most of the parameter space,
                    i.e., the elasticity is smaller 
                    than expected for an optimizing agent.
                \item This is
                    especially true once off the boundary
                    and is stronger for high CU participants.

                    t-statistic for
                    each experiment.

                    for reference.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Under the authors' specification, we have:
            \begin{align}
                \frac{\partial \mathbb{E}\left[a_{i, j}^e\right]}{\partial \theta_j^e}=\gamma^e+\beta^e \mathrm{CU}
            \end{align}
        \item From which, we can define another measure for 
            cross-experiment comparison:
            \begin{align}
                C U \text { attenuation ratio } & \equiv \frac{(\text { Sensitivity at } C U=0)-(\text { Sensitivity at } C U=0.5)}{(\text { Sensitivity at } C U=0)} \\
                & =-\frac{0.5 \hat{\beta}^e}{\hat{\gamma}^e}
            \end{align}
        \item Interpretation: How much the sensitivity
            decreases as CU increases from 0 to 0.5.

\begin{frame}{Attenuation to Objective Benchmarks}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item We then consider the subset of experiments 
            with objective benchmarks.
        \item The authors estimate:
            \begin{align}
                a_{i, j}^e=v^e+\omega^e \theta_j^e+\sum_x \chi^e d_x^e+u_{i, j}^e
            \end{align}
            where the term of interest is 
            $\omega^e$.
        \item Specifically, we consider 
            the ratio between the estimated
            $\omega^e$ and the rational benchmark: 
            \begin{align}
                \frac{\hat{\omega}^e}{\omega_R^e}
            \end{align}

                \item The red and blue symbols plot the fitted values 
                    at 100\% CU and 0\% CU, respectively.
                \item The main takeaway is to notice that all 
                    dots are below one and the high and low CU 
                    split as expected.

\begin{frame}{Within- and Across-Subject Variation}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Subject FE 
            explain 44\% of the variation in CU,
            suggesting that subject-level
            differences in cognitive ability 
            -- the so-called ``supply side''
            of information processing -- 
            may be important for attenuation
        \item The authors then estimate an adjusted version 
            of the earlier specification 
                \begin{align}
                    a_{i, j}^e=\alpha^e+\gamma^e \theta_j^e+\beta^e \theta_j^e \overline{CU}_{i}^e+\delta^e \overline{CU}_{i}^e+\sum_x \chi^e d_x^e+\epsilon_{i, j}^e
                \end{align}
            with $\overline{CU}_{i}^e$ rather than $ C U_{i, j}^e$
            reflecting the use of the subject-level average,
            rather than the individual decision's CU.
        \item This results in a large drop in the 
            average attenuation effect size (33.0 to 8.8) and
            t-statistic (-4.8 to -1.39),
            suggesting a meaningful role for within-subject variation.

\begin{frame}{Problem Complexity and Diminishing Sensitivity}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The authors now 
            leverage the fact that,
            within a given task type, 
            some configurations of the 
            task will demand more 
            information-processing 
            than others.
        \vfill
        \item Motivated by this, we 
            first return to the ``simple points''

\begin{frame}{Diminishing Sensitivity}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The presented model 
            predicts that there should be diminished 
            sensitivity to the parameter value
            as the distance from the boundary
            increases due to the heightened 
            CU.
        \item To assess for diminished sensitivity, the 
            authors estimate
            \begin{align}
                a_{i, j}^e=\alpha_d^e+\gamma_d^e \theta_j^e+\beta_d^e \theta_j^e \Delta_j^e+\delta^e \Delta_j^e+\sum_x \chi^e d_x^e+v_{i, j}^e
            \end{align}
            where $\Delta_j^e$ is the distance from the
            nearest boundary
        \item Diminished sensitivity is captured by: $\hat{\beta}_d^e<0$.

                    by comparing

                    across experiments by computing

\begin{frame}{Discussion}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Behavioral attenuation can (at least partially)
            explain many previously studied
            anomalies, including many explored in the paper.
        \item Additionally, the authors argue that 
            behavioral attenuation offers
            a more parsimonious explanation
            than the oft-offered alternative of 
            domain-specific preferences.
        \item Finally, the authors conclude 
            with a note of optimism for the 
            power of the cognitive lens to 
            speak to a wide variety of 
            economic phenomena with 
            only a limited set of principles.
