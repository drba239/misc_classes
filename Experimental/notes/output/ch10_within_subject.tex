\section{Main Takeaways}

\subsection{Additional Assumptions from Within-Subjects Design}


\begin{enumerate}
    \item (A10.1, Balanced Panel): For all $(i, t) \in \mathcal{J} \times \mathcal{T}$, we have $\mathbb{P}\left[R_{i t}=1\right]=1$, and for all $(i, t) \in \mathcal{J} \times \mathcal{T}$ with $\mathbb{P}\left[R_{i t}=1\right]=1$ the researcher observes $\left(Y_{i t}, D_{i t}, Z_{i t}, \boldsymbol{X}_{i t}\right)$.
    \item (A10.2, Temporal Stability): For all $t \in \mathcal{T}, Y_{i t}\left(D_{i t}, \boldsymbol{D}_{i,-t}, t\right)=Y_{i t}\left(D_{i t}, \boldsymbol{D}_{i,-\boldsymbol{t}}\right)$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This rules out time-varying effects in the potential outcomes, 
                such as respondent fatigue.
        \end{itemize}
    \item (A10.3, Causal Transience): For all $\boldsymbol{D}_{\boldsymbol{i}}, Y_{i t}\left(D_{i t}, \boldsymbol{D}_{\boldsymbol{i}}, T\right)=Y_{i t}\left(D_{i t}, T\right)$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This implies that the treatment effect does not persist over time 
                when we change the treatment status; the treatment effects 
                do not depend on the order in which they are implemented.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Highlighting 3 Threats to Temporal Stability}

``The literature has enumerated various threats to temporal 
stability and here we focus on three key threats: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item time-specific shocks to the outcome, 
    \item time trends such as learning or regression to the mean, and 
    \item the measurement outcome might change over time.'' 
\end{enumerate}

Examples: The Hawthorne effect being just a day-of-the-week effect.


\subsection{Randomize Treatment Order}

One way to control for time effects 
is to ``generate different random orders of the treatment conditions.''

\subsection{Threats to Causal Transience}

``The main threats to causal transience are anticipation and 
carry-over effects. Anticipation effects occur when subjects 
change their behavior because of treatments that will
happen in the future...
Carry-over effects occur when the impact of treatment persists through the measurement.''

``Researchers may detect carry-over effects if 
they counterbalance treatment regimes and compare 
the effects of a given treatment by position. If effects 
are asymmetric, carry-over effects may be confounding the results.''

\subsection{Key Advantages of Within-Subject Design}

We can retrieve:

\begin{align}
    \tau_i \equiv Y_{i t}(1)-Y_{i t}(0)
\end{align}

They offer increased power.
