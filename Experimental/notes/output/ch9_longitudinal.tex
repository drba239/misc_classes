\section{Main Takeaways}

\subsection{Gains from Pre-Treatment Outcome Measures}

Consider the two parameters:

\begin{align}
        \tau^{D I D}=\tau^{\text {post }} & -\tau^{\text {pre }} \\
        = & \sum_{t>0}\left(\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i t} \mid D_{i t}=1\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i t} \mid D_{i t}=0\right]\right) \\
        & -\sum_{t \leq 0}\left(\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i t} \mid D_{i t}=1\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i t} \mid D_{i t}=0\right]\right)
\end{align}

and

\begin{align}
    \tau^{\text {Post }}=\sum_{t>0}\left(\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i t} \mid D_{i t}=1\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i t} \mid D_{i t}=0\right]\right)
\end{align}

When you have pre-treatment observations, there are instances 
where it may be beneficial to include them in your specification 
and instances where it may not be. This depends on how many 
pre-treatment observations you have and the strength of the 
autocorrelation parameter.

Under the assumptions of 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item constant variance across time periods, 
    \item equal variances between all pairs of time points
    \item autocorrelation in outcomes does not depend on treatment effects
    \item treatment and control groups are identical in cross-sectional size
\end{enumerate}

we have 

\begin{align}
    \operatorname{Var}\left[\tau^{\text {Post }}\right]=\frac{2 \sigma^2}{n_d}\left(\frac{1+\left(N_{\text {Post }}-1\right) \rho}{N_{\text {Post }}}\right)
\end{align}

and 

\begin{align}
    \operatorname{Var}\left[\tau^{D I D}\right]=\frac{2 \sigma^2}{n_d}\left(\frac{1+\left(N_{\text {Post }}-1\right) \rho}{N_{\text {Post }}}-\frac{\left(N_{\text {Pre }}+1\right) \rho-1}{N_{\text {Pre }}}\right)
\end{align}

Below is a guide:

\subsection{Choosing the Optimal Number of Pre- and Post- Periods}

The smallest sample size correspond to a 
given MDE is given by:

\begin{align}
    n_0^*=n_1^*=n^*=\frac{2\left(t_{\alpha / 2}+t_\beta\right)^2 \sigma^2}{(M D E)^2}\left(\frac{N_{\text {Pre }}+N_{\text {Post }}}{N_{\text {Pre }} * N_{\text {Post }}}\right)
\end{align}

As the number of periods increases from 4 to 16, the 
minimum sample size required to detect a given MDE
decreases four-fold.

\subsection{Solomon 4-Group Design}

One may worry that taking measures repeatedly 
may influence participants' responses (e.g., if they 
get tired of responding). One way to get around this 
is to use the Solomon 4-group design. Under this design,
participants are randomly divided into to 2, where 
half are given a pre-test and half are not. Then,
post-test outcomes are measured for all participants
and compared based on whether they received a pre-test. 
If results are similar across groups, they can be pooled.


\subsection{Causal Density}


``The actual measurement of a long run treatment effect and the discovered underlying 
mechanisms at work depends on the outcome's causal density.

The causal density of an outcome variable refers to how well the 
determinants of the outcome are understood. An outcome with low 
causal density is one where the factors determining the outcome 
are well understood. For example, farmers have a near-perfect 
understanding of the determinants of crop yields, yielding a low 
causal density. In contrast, the determinants of labor market 
outcomes are much less well understood and thus have high causal density. 
For example, future employment and wage outcomes are a function 
of the numerous and interconnected inputs by multiple people 
and institutions.''

``As the time between experiment and observation of the outcome increases, 
so do the number of potential mechanisms driving the effect and
the causal density. For example, consider the question of 
whether financial incentives increase test scores. Suppose 
the researcher announces the incentives right before 
she administers the test. In that case, one can be 
reasonably sure that the only mechanism through which the
treatment works is the student's effort on the test. 
Conversely, suppose that the researcher announces the 
financial incentives months before administering the test.
Then, the student's effort remains a potential mechanism.
However, possible changes to the student's test score
could arise through her own study effort or even investment
rom her parents, teachers, or peers. This general
problem is one of forecasting long-term treatment outcomes, 
and its applicability is quite widespread.''

\subsection{Surrogates}

When we are interested in the long-run effect of something 
but may be interested in expanding the policy before we 
can observe the long-run effect, we may use a surrogate
to estimate the long-run effect. In this case, under strong assumptions,
we consider the effect of the treatment on the surrogate
and the effect of the surrogate on the long-run outcome.

The key assumptions are:

\begin{notes}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item (A9.3, Comparability): $P_i \perp Y_i \mid Y_i^S$
            \begin{itemize}
                \item That is, 
                    the ``conditional distribution of the primary 
                    outcome given the surrogates is the
                    same in the observational and experimental samples.''
            \end{itemize}
        \item A linear relationship between the outcome and the surrogate
        \item $\text{Var}\left[Y_i^S \mid D_i\right]=\text{Var}\left[Y_i \mid D_i\right]$
        \item (A9.4, Surrogacy Condition): $D_i \perp Y_i \mid Y_i^S$
            \begin{itemize}
                \item ``The surrogacy condition requires that the surrogate 
                fully captures the causal link between the treatment and 
                the primary outcome. Under the surrogacy condition, 
                there remains no treatment effect on the outcome after 
                conditioning on the surrogate.''
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{notes}

Under these conditions, we get:

\begin{align}
    \tau=\rho_{Y_i, Y_i^S} \cdot \tau^s
\end{align}

If the surrogacy condition doesn't hold, we instead get:

\begin{align}
    \tau=\rho_{Y_i, Y_i^S} \cdot \tau^S+\left(\mathbb{E}\left[Y_i \mid Y_i^S, D_i=1\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[Y_i \mid Y_i^S, D_i=0\right]\right)
\end{align}
