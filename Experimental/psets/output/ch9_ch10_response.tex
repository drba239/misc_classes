\section{Ch. 9 Question Responses}

\subsection{Question 1}

Suppose you run an experiment to look at long-run outcomes of an intervention. You suspect that the treatment will make subjects less sensitive to shocks. How may this affect your selection of sample size allocated to treatment and control?

\hrulefill\hspace{0.5em}\dotfill\hspace{0.5em}\hrulefill

The diminished sensitivity will increase autocorrelation,
implying relatively less information gained for additional 
time series observations. 
We should allocate more observations to 
the condition where autocorrelation is lower,
i.e., the control.

We should set sample sizes according to the formula:

\begin{align}
    \frac{n_1}{n_0}=\sqrt{\frac{1+\left(N_{\text {Post }}-1\right) \rho_1}{1+\left(N_{\text {Post }}-1\right) \rho_0}}
\end{align}

\subsection{Question 2}
A researcher finds in a longitudinal experiment that treatment increases consumption measured at 1 year post-treatment by a precise $30 \%$, and the treatment effect after two years is only $3 \%$. Can we conclude that consumption after one year is not a valid surrogate (does not meet the surrogacy condition) for consumption after two years in this experiment?

\hrulefill\hspace{0.5em}\dotfill\hspace{0.5em}\hrulefill

Without additional information, this fact alone 
does not imply that consumption after one year is not a valid surrogate.
It could, in principle, be the case that 
this is the relationship between consumption from year to year 
in observational samples and that the full causal relationship between
the treatment and consumption after two years is captured 
by consumption after one year -- although it may be 
kind of strange if these conditions are satisfied in this case.

\section{Main Takeaways}

\subsection{Ch. 9 Takeaways}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider the two parameters:

        \begin{align}
                \tau^{D I D}=\tau^{\text {post }} & -\tau^{\text {pre }} \\
                = & \sum_{t>0}\left(\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i t} \mid D_{i t}=1\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i t} \mid D_{i t}=0\right]\right) \\
                & -\sum_{t \leq 0}\left(\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i t} \mid D_{i t}=1\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i t} \mid D_{i t}=0\right]\right)
        \end{align}
        
        and
        
        \begin{align}
            \tau^{\text {Post }}=\sum_{t>0}\left(\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i t} \mid D_{i t}=1\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i t} \mid D_{i t}=0\right]\right)
        \end{align}
        
        When you have pre-treatment observations, there are instances 
        where it may be beneficial to include them in your specification 
        and instances where it may not be. This depends on how many 
        pre-treatment observations you have and the strength of the 
        autocorrelation parameter.
        
        Under the assumptions of 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item constant variance across time periods, 
            \item equal variances between all pairs of time points
            \item autocorrelation in outcomes does not depend on treatment effects
            \item treatment and control groups are identical in cross-sectional size
        \end{enumerate}
        
        we have 
        
        \begin{align}
            \operatorname{Var}\left[\tau^{\text {Post }}\right]=\frac{2 \sigma^2}{n_d}\left(\frac{1+\left(N_{\text {Post }}-1\right) \rho}{N_{\text {Post }}}\right)
        \end{align}
        
        and 
        
        \begin{align}
            \operatorname{Var}\left[\tau^{D I D}\right]=\frac{2 \sigma^2}{n_d}\left(\frac{1+\left(N_{\text {Post }}-1\right) \rho}{N_{\text {Post }}}-\frac{\left(N_{\text {Pre }}+1\right) \rho-1}{N_{\text {Pre }}}\right)
        \end{align}
        
    \item The smallest sample size correspond to a 
        given MDE is given by:
        
        \begin{align}
            n_0^*=n_1^*=n^*=\frac{2\left(t_{\alpha / 2}+t_\beta\right)^2 \sigma^2}{(M D E)^2}\left(\frac{N_{\text {Pre }}+N_{\text {Post }}}{N_{\text {Pre }} * N_{\text {Post }}}\right)
        \end{align}
        
        As the number of periods increases from 4 to 16, the 
        minimum sample size required to detect a given MDE
        decreases four-fold.
    \item When we are interested in the long-run effect of something 
    but may be interested in expanding the policy before we 
    can observe the long-run effect, we may use a surrogate
    to estimate the long-run effect. In this case, under strong assumptions,
    we consider the effect of the treatment on the surrogate
    and the effect of the surrogate on the long-run outcome.
    
    The key assumptions are:
    
    \begin{notes}[Assumptions]
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item (A9.3, Comparability): $P_i \perp Y_i \mid Y_i^S$
            \item A linear relationship between the outcome and the surrogate
            \item $\text{Var}\left[Y_i^S \mid D_i\right]=\text{Var}\left[Y_i \mid D_i\right]$
            \item (A9.4, Surrogacy Condition): $D_i \perp Y_i \mid Y_i^S$
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{notes}
    
    Under these conditions, we get:
    
    \begin{align}
        \tau=\rho_{Y_i, Y_i^S} \cdot \tau^s
    \end{align}
    
    If the surrogacy condition doesn't hold, we instead get:
    
    \begin{align}
        \tau=\rho_{Y_i, Y_i^S} \cdot \tau^S+\left(\mathbb{E}\left[Y_i \mid Y_i^S, D_i=1\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[Y_i \mid Y_i^S, D_i=0\right]\right)
    \end{align}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ch. 10 Takeaways}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Additional assumptions required for within-subjects are:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item (A10.1, Balanced Panel): For all $(i, t) \in \mathcal{J} \times \mathcal{T}$, we have $\mathbb{P}\left[R_{i t}=1\right]=1$, and for all $(i, t) \in \mathcal{J} \times \mathcal{T}$ with $\mathbb{P}\left[R_{i t}=1\right]=1$ the researcher observes $\left(Y_{i t}, D_{i t}, Z_{i t}, \boldsymbol{X}_{i t}\right)$.
            \item (A10.2, Temporal Stability): For all $t \in \mathcal{T}, Y_{i t}\left(D_{i t}, \boldsymbol{D}_{i,-t}, t\right)=Y_{i t}\left(D_{i t}, \boldsymbol{D}_{i,-\boldsymbol{t}}\right)$.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item This rules out time-varying effects in the potential outcomes, 
                        such as respondent fatigue.
                \end{itemize}
            \item (A10.3, Causal Transience): For all $\boldsymbol{D}_{\boldsymbol{i}}, Y_{i t}\left(D_{i t}, \boldsymbol{D}_{\boldsymbol{i}}, T\right)=Y_{i t}\left(D_{i t}, T\right)$.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item This implies that the treatment effect does not persist over time 
                        when we change the treatment status; the treatment effects 
                        do not depend on the order in which they are implemented.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate} 
    \item Three major threats to temporal stability are:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item time-specific shocks
            \item time trends
            \item changing measurement outcome
        \end{itemize}
    \item If the assumptions are tenable, within-subjects designs can 
        reach high power levels much faster than between-subjects designs.
\end{enumerate}
