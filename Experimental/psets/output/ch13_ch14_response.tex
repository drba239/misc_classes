\section{Ch. 13 Question Responses}

\subsection{Question 1}

In what scenarios would it be appropriate to use `As-Treated,' `Intent-to-Treat (ITT),' or `Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)' analysis? 
Please illustrate with simple examples.

\hrulefill\hspace{0.5em}\dotfill\hspace{0.5em}\hrulefill

You would use As-Treated when you are interested in the effect 
of the treatment on those who truly received it, e.g., 
if one is interpreted in the effect of a job training program 
on people who attended.

You would use ITT when you are interested in the effect of 
attempting to treat people, e.g., if you want to know 
the effect of an ad campaign.

You would use LATE when you are interested in the effect 
on people who would only comply with the treatment
when assigned to it and not otherwise, e.g., if you 
are interested in the effect of a tutoring program 
on the subset of students who were offered it that 
decided to attend.

\subsection{Question 2}

With the information provided in the chapter, imagine 
you are replicating Dal BÃ³ et al. (2018). Based on what 
you learned in the chapter, what precautions would you 
take, or what would you do differently to reduce noncompliance?

\hrulefill\hspace{0.5em}\dotfill\hspace{0.5em}\hrulefill

If I suppose that I'm truly interested in the effect of 
updating people's beliefs, rather than the effect 
of the information treatment itself, then I may try to 
incentivize people to make sure that they pay attention 
to the details of the information treatment, increasing the 
chances that they update their beliefs. I may do a 
comprehension check to at least confirm that they 
understood what was being said, even if they don't fully 
buy into it. Perhaps swapping the treatment with something 
stronger, like having them watch the relevant games 
unfold (perhaps recorded), could increase the 
impact of the treatment on the beliefs of the subjects.

\section{Main Takeaways}

\subsection{Ch. 13 Takeaways}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Amid imperfect compliance, we may still be able to estimate 
        the ITT and LATE, which, in some circumstances, may 
        be a parameter of interest.
    \item One-sided imperfect compliance occurs 
        when either a subset of the treatment group fails to 
        receive treatment or a subset of the control group
        receives treatment. Two-sided imperfect compliance
        occurs when both of these conditions are met.
    \item Non-compliance can be attenuated within the 
        design, such as by strategically placing incentives or 
        minimizing complexity.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ch. 14 Takeaways}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We can test for failed randomization 
        and should have a rerandomization mechanism in place
        so that we can employ randomization-conscious inference.
    \item When randomization is compromised with full 
        documentation, we can use tools from 
        observational econometrics.
    \item When randomization is compromised with only 
        partial documentation, we must turn to proposing 
        an economic model to advance with what knowledge we 
        do have about the compromised randomization, as 
        in the Perry Preschool Project.
\end{enumerate}
