\section{The Model}

\subsection{Preferences and Endowments}

\subsubsection{Preferences}

The preferences of a worker who lives in
location $n$ and works in location $i$ 
is given by the following utility function
of the Cobb-Douglas form:

\begin{align}
    U_{n i \omega}=\frac{b_{n i \omega}}{\kappa_{n i}}\left(\frac{C_{n \omega}}{\alpha}\right)^\alpha\left(\frac{H_{n \omega}}{1-\alpha}\right)^{1-\alpha}
\end{align}

Idiosyncratic amenities 
are drawn from 
an independent FrÃ©chet distribution:

\begin{align}
    G_{n i}(b)=e^{-B_{n i} b^{-\epsilon}}, \quad B_{n i}>0, \epsilon>1
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Good Consumption Index}

The good consumption index is given the form:

\begin{align}
    C_n=\left[\sum_{i \in N} \int_0^{M_i} c_{n i}(j)^\rho d j\right]^{\frac{1}{\rho}}, \quad \sigma=\frac{1}{1-\rho}>1
\end{align}

``The goods consumption index in location $n$ is a constant elasticity of 
substitution (CES) function of consumption of a continuum of tradable 
varieties sourced from each location $i$.''

Utility maximization 
will give that ``the equilibrium consumption 
in location $n$ of each variety sourced from 
location $i$ 
is given by'':

\begin{align}
    c_{n i}(j)=\alpha X_n P_n^{\sigma-1} p_{n i}(j)^{-\sigma} \label{eq:good_nij_consumption}
\end{align}

See \autoref{sec:good_nij_consumption} for derivation.

\subsubsection{Land and Local Consumption}

``We assume that this land is owned by immobile landlords,
who receive worker expenditure on residential land as income, and consume only
goods where they live.''

From there, we get the expression

\begin{align}
    P_n C_n=\alpha \bar{v}_n R_n+(1-\alpha) \bar{v}_n R_n=\bar{v}_n R_n
\end{align}

which says that the 
total expenditure on goods in location $n$, $P_n C_n$
is equal to the total labor income of 
residents in location $n$, $\bar{v}_n R_n$.

\begin{questions}
    Should I be saying ``total labor income'' or just ``total income''
    for $\bar{v}_n R_n$?
\end{questions}

The middle term can be read as 
residents total spending on goods in $n$,
$\alpha \bar{v}_n R_n$, plus 
residents total spending on land in $n$,
$(1-\alpha) \bar{v}_n R_n$.

We can also get the following expression:

\begin{align}
    Q_n=(1-\alpha) \frac{\bar{v}_n R_n}{H_n}
\end{align}

which says that 
the land price in location $n$, $Q_n$,
is equal to the total spending on land in $n$ 
divided by the supply of land in $n$.

This follows from the land market clearing condition:

\begin{align}
    \underbrace{Q_n \times H_n}_{\text {price } \times \text { quantity of land }}=\underbrace{(1-\alpha) \bar{v}_n R_n}_{\text {total rent paid by residents }}
\end{align}

and is useful, because it allows us to express 
rent as a function of the supply of land.

\begin{questions}
    Why do we only say that it's a function of the supply of land?
    It seems to be a function of several things, no?
\end{questions}

\section{Production}

Firms produce tradable varieties under 
monopolistic competition
and increasing returns to scale
using labor as the lone input. 

To produce a variety, firms incur 
a fixed cost, $F$, as well as a 
variable cost
that is determined by the inverse 
of local productivity, $A_i(j)$: $x_i(j)/A_i(j)$.

Thus, the total amount of labor, $l_i(j)$, required to produce
$x_i(j)$ units of variety $j$ in location $i$ is
given by:

\begin{align}
    l_i(j)=F+ \frac{x_i(j)}{A_i(j)}
\end{align}

\section{Derivations}

\subsection{Derivation of $c_{n i}(j)$ Expression} 
\label{sec:good_nij_consumption}

\subsubsection{Write the Problem}
This is the derivation of \eqref{eq:good_nij_consumption}.

When making consumption decisions surrounding
$c_{n i}(j)$, an individual is solving the following problem:

\begin{align}
    &\underset{\{c_{n i}(j)\}}{\max} C_n \\ 
    \text{s.t. } &\sum_i \int_{0}^{M_i} p_{n i}(j) c_{n i}(j) d j=\alpha X_n
\end{align}

or expanded out:

\begin{align}
    &\underset{\{c_{n i}(j)\}}{\max} \left[\sum_{i \in N} \int_0^{M_i} c_{n i}(j)^\rho d j\right]^{\frac{1}{\rho}} \\
    \text{s.t. } &\sum_i \int_{0}^{M_i} p_{n i}(j) c_{n i}(j) d j=\alpha X_n
\end{align}

where the $\alpha X_n$ term comes from the fact that 
people spend $\alpha$ of their total expenditures, $X_n$,
on goods.

\subsubsection{Lagrangian and FOCs}

The Langragian for this problem is then:

\begin{align}
    \mathcal{L} = \left[\sum_{i \in N} \int_0^{M_i} c_{n i}(j)^\rho d j\right]^{\frac{1}{\rho}} + \lambda \left(\alpha X_n - \sum_i \int_{0}^{M_i} p_{n i}(j) c_{n i}(j) d j\right)
\end{align}

which gives the relevant FOC:

\begin{align}
    \{c_{n i}(j)\} \quad \quad &\frac{\partial}{\partial c_{n i}(j)} \left[\left(\sum_{i \in N} \int_0^{M_i} c_{n i}(j)^\rho d j\right)^{\frac{1}{\rho}}\right] - \lambda p_{n i}(j) = 0 \\
    \Leftrightarrow & \frac{1}{\rho} \left[\sum_{i \in N} \int_0^{M_i} \rho c_{n i}(j)^\rho d j\right]^{\frac{1}{\rho}-1} c_{n i}(j)^{\rho-1} - \lambda p_{n i}(j) = 0 \\
    \Leftrightarrow & C_n^{1-\rho} c_{n i}(j)^{\rho-1} = \lambda p_{n i}(j) \\
    \Leftrightarrow & c_{n i}(j) = \lambda^{\frac{1}{\rho -1}} p_{ni}(j)^{\frac{1}{\rho -1}} C_n \\ 
    \Leftrightarrow & c_{n i}(j) = \lambda^{-\sigma} p_{ni}(j)^{-\sigma} C_n && \text{since $\sigma = \frac{1}{1-\rho}$} \label{eq:inter_good_nij_cons}
\end{align}


\subsubsection{Solve for $\lambda$}

From there, we can define the dual price index 

\begin{align}
    P_n \equiv \left(\sum_{i \in N} \int_0^{M_i} p_{n i}(j)^{1-\sigma} d_j \right)^{\frac{1}{1-\sigma}}
\end{align}

and revisit to our budget constraint:

\begin{alignat}{2}
    &\alpha X_n && = \sum_i \int_{0}^{M_i} p_{n i}(j) c_{n i}(j) d j \\
    &&&= \sum_i \int_{0}^{M_i} p_{n i}(j) \lambda^{-\sigma} p_{ni}(j)^{-\sigma} C_n d j \quad \text{by \eqref{eq:inter_good_nij_cons}} \\
    &&&= \lambda^{-\sigma} C_n \sum_i \int_{0}^{M_i} p_{n i}(j)^{1-\sigma} d j \\
    &&& = \lambda^{-\sigma} C_n P_n^{1-\sigma} \\
    \Rightarrow &\lambda^{-\sigma} &&= \frac{\alpha X_n}{C_n} P_n^{\sigma-1} \\
\end{alignat}

\subsubsection{Plug in $\lambda$}

Then, returning to \eqref{eq:inter_good_nij_cons}, we can plug in our expression for $\lambda^{-\sigma}$:

\begin{align}
    c_{n i}(j) &= \lambda^{-\sigma} p_{ni}(j)^{-\sigma} C_n \\
    &= \left(\frac{\alpha X_n}{C_n} P_n^{\sigma-1}\right) p_{ni}(j)^{-\sigma} C_n \\
    &= \alpha X_n P_n^{\sigma-1} p_{ni}(j)^{-\sigma}
\end{align}

which is what we wanted.
