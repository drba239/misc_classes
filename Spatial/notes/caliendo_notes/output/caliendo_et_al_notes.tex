\section{The Model}

\subsection{Initial Setup}


``In each region-sector combination,
there is a competitive labor market. 
In each market, there is a continuum of perfectly
competitive firms producing intermediate goods.''

Firms have a Cobb-Douglas Constant-Returns-to-Scale (CRS)
production function, which utilizes labor, 
``composite local factor that we refer to as structures, 
and materials from all sectors.''

We assume that productivities 
are 
``distributed Fr√©chet with a sector-specific
productivity dispersion parameter $\theta^j$.''

Time is discrete, $t=0,1,2, \ldots$.

``Households are forward looking,
have perfect foresight, and optimally decide where to 
move given some initial distribution of labor 
across locations and sectors.
Households face costs to move across markets
and experience an idiosyncratic shock that affects their moving decision.''

\subsection{Household Problem}

At $t=0$, there is a mass of households 
in location $n$ and sector $j$, denoted by $L_0^{n j}$.
Households are either \emph{employed} or 
\emph{non-employed}.

If employed in location $n$ and sector $j$ at time $t$, 
workers inelastically supply a unit of labor 
and receive wage $w_t^{n j}$.

Given income, the household decides how to allocate 
their consumption over final goods across sectors 
with a Cobb-Douglas aggregator. Preferences,
$U\left(C_t^{n j}\right)$, are over 
baskets of final local goods:

\begin{align}
    C_t^{n j}=\prod_{k=1}^J\left(c_t^{n j, k}\right)^{\alpha^k}
\end{align}

``Households are forward-looking 
and discount the future at rate $\beta \geq 0$.
Migration decisions are subject to sectoral and spatial 
mobility costs.''

\begin{notes}[Assumption 1]
    Labor relocation costs $\tau^{n j, i k} \geq 0$ depend on the origin ($n j$) and destination ($ik$) and are time invariant, additive, and measured in terms of utility.
\end{notes}

Households have idiosyncratic shocks $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_t^{i k}$ for each choice of market.


The timing for the household's problem is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Households observe the economic conditions in each market, as well 
        as their own idiosyncratic shocks.
    \item Returns
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If they begin the period in the labor market, they work 
            and receive the market wage.
            \item  If they are non-employed in a region, they receive 
                home production.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Households choose whether to relocate.
\end{enumerate}

Formally:

\begin{align}
    \mathrm{v}_t^{n j}=&U\left(C_t^{n j}\right)+\max _{\{i, k\}_{i=1, k=0}^{N, J}}\left\{\beta E\left[\mathrm{v}_{t+1}^{i k}\right]-\tau^{n j, i k}+\nu \epsilon_t^{i k}\right\} \\
    & \text { s.t. } C_t^{n j} \equiv \begin{cases}b^n & \text { if } j=0 \\
    w_t^{n j} / P_t^n & \text { otherwise }\end{cases}
\end{align}

$\mathrm{v}_t^{n j}$ is the lifetime utility of a 
household currently in location $n$ and sector $j$ at time $t$, with 
the expectation taken over future realizations of the idiosyncratic shock. 
$\nu$ is a parameter that scales the variance of the idiosyncratic shock.

Households choose to move to the labor market 
with the highest utility net of costs.

\begin{notes}[Assumption 2]
    The idiosyncratic shock $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ is i.i.d. over time 
    and distributed Type-I Extreme Value with zero mean.
